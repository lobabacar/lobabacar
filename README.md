## About me

Currently, I work as a project assistant in geomatics at the Bureau of Applied Ecology, where I am responsible for conducting spatial analyses, cartography, and remote sensing for various environmental projects.

My experience includes developing and using artificial intelligence models for analyzing the phenological cycles of plants using drone imagery, as well as estimating the structural parameters of trees through AI technology and platforms like Google Earth Engine. I have also worked on satellite-based flood detection projects at the Laboratory of Applied Remote Sensing (LTA) and conducted various assignments at the National Center for Forest Resources (CNRF) in Senegal.
